        //Hello Everyone, Here is another Homework for you to work on for the String Methods.

        // 1. First create one string and copy paste below paragraf.
        // 2. And make modifications on the given paragraph listed below.

        //Make sure to create multiple string with each sentence from given paragraph
        //Make sure each sentence start with upper case letter.
        //Make sure city name start with the capital letter.
        //Make sure the rest of the letters are lower case.
        //Make sure to change the name, age and city information based on your information
        //make sure to get rid of the empty spaces in front and end of the sentences.

        //after you make the modification check each sentenseâ€™s length
        //Print each sentence and make sure they are correctly modified.
        //Print 1st, 4th and 5th indexed characters for each sentence
        //At the end combine all the sentence to get proper paragraph with modified sentences

        // hello my name is <yourname>.
        // I am <yourage> years old.
